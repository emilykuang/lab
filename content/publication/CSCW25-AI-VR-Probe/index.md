abstract: 'Inter-generational communication plays a vital role in bridging generational gaps and fostering mutual understanding. However, it remains challenging due to differences in cultural norms, communication styles, and geographical separation. While prior studies have shown Virtual Reality (VR) as a medium that fosters a relaxed atmosphere and companionship, its capacity to address the nuanced dynamics of inter-generational dialogue, such as divergent values and relational intricacies, remains limited. To address this gap, we explored the opportunities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to support inter-generational communication in VR. We developed three technology probes (e.g., Content Generator, Communication Facilitator, and Info Assistant) in VR and employed them in a probe-based participatory design study with twelve inter-generational pairs. Our results show that AI-powered VR facilitates inter-generational communication by enhancing mutual understanding, fostering conversation fluency, and promoting active participation. We also introduce several challenges when using AI-powered VR in supporting inter-generational communication and derive design implications for future VR platforms, aiming to improve inter-generational communication.'
