abstract = {People who are blind and low vision (BLV) encounter numerous challenges in their daily lives and work. To support them, various haptic assistive tools have been developed. Despite these advancements, the effective utilization of these tools—including the optimal haptic feedback and on-body stimulation positions for different tasks along with their limitations—remains poorly understood. Recognizing these gaps, we conducted a systematic literature review spanning two decades (2004–2024) to evaluate the development of haptic assistive tools within the HCI community. Our findings reveal that these tools are primarily used for understanding graphical information, providing guidance and navigation, and facilitating education and training, among other life and work tasks. We identified three main limitations: hardware limitations, functionality limitations, and UX and evaluation methods limitations. Based on these insights, we discuss potential research avenues and offer suggestions for enhancing the effectiveness of future haptic assistive technologies.},
