abstract = {Evaluating VR usability presents unique challenges, particularly when designing for older adults. This study explores how AI-generated suggestions might support UX evaluators in identifying usability problems in VR games. Eight evaluators reviewed videos of older adults interacting with a VR game under two conditions: with and without AI assistance. Older adults commonly encountered problems related to unclear instructions, confusing game mechanics, and poor menu navigation. Evaluators in the AI condition identified more usability issues overall, including additional categories such as font size and scoring confusion. While preliminary, these findings suggest that AI tools may help expand evaluators’ perspectives, especially in contexts where they lack relevant lived experience.},
