abstract: 'The global aging trend compels older adults to navigate the evolving digital landscape, presenting a substantial challenge in mastering smartphone applications. While Augmented Reality (AR) holds promise for enhancing learning and user experience, its role in aiding older adults’ smartphone app exploration remains insufficiently explored. Therefore, we conducted a two-phase study: (1) a workshop with 18 older adults to identify app exploration challenges and potential AR interventions, and (2) tech-probe participatory design sessions with 15 participants to co-create AR support tools. Our research highlights AR’s effectiveness in reducing physical and cognitive strain among older adults during app exploration, especially during multi-app usage and the trial-and-error learning process. We also examined their interactional experiences with AR, yielding design considerations on tailoring AR tools for smartphone app exploration. Ultimately, our study unveils the prospective landscape of AR in supporting the older demographic, both presently and in future scenarios.'
