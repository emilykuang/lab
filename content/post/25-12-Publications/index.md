Our lab has two new publications this semester: 

##### [**Evaluating Usability Challenges in VR Games for Older Adults: A Comparison With and Without AI Assistance**](/lab/publication/UIST25-VR-Usability/)

In Adjunct Proceedings of the 38th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology. Key highlights:
- Older adults encountered several usability problems in VR, including unclear instructions and goals, confusing game mechanics, and difficult-to-navigate menus.
- AI-generated suggestions helped UX evaluators to identify a greater number of usability problems.


##### [**LLM-powered assistant with electrotactile feedback to assist blind and low vision people with maps and routes preview**](/lab/publication/IJHCS-BLV-Maps)

In the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies. Key highlights:
- An LLM-powered assistant that supports natural language queries about map elements, route conditions, and trajectories. 
- A wearable electrotactile feedback device that conveys map features via haptic signals. 
- A user study with blind and low vision participants demonstrating improved efficiency and spatial understanding of route previews.
